## Author: Alerick Langlois #2546596

This is a School System developed in Java for the final project of the Introduction to Programming course.

The goal of this project is to build a simple school management system, including students, courses, departments, and assignments.
It allows students to register or to drop courses, which contain assignments. 
Averages and final scores can be easily be generated, be calculated, and be displayed.
